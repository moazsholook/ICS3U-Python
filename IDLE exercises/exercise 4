#The program compares the numerical values of the words. letters that come later in the alphabet have greater numerical values than letters that come earlier in the alphabet.

#The program converts the input into all lowercase letters so that it can compare strictly alphabetical order since capital letters have lower value than lowercase letters

word1 = input("Enter a word: ").lower()
word2 = input("Enter another: ").lower()

if word1 > word2:
  print(f"{word1} comes after {word2} in alphabetical order")
elif word2 > word1:
  print(f"{word2} comes after {word1} in alphabetical order")
else:
  print(f"{word1} and {word2} are the same")
